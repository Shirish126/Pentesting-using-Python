# Automating Pentesting Tasks Using Python

This project aims to automate various penetration testing tasks using Python scripts. The toolkit includes tools for reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting, providing a comprehensive framework for performing penetration tests.

## Overview

Penetration testing, also known as pentesting, is a method of evaluating the security of a system or network by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders (external testing) and malicious insiders (internal testing). The process involves four main stages:

1. **Reconnaissance**
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
3. **Exploitation**
4. **Reporting**

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following sections, each corresponding to a stage in the penetration testing process:

### 1. Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target system. The scripts in this section help identify subdomains, directories, open ports, and collect publicly available information such as emails.

- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Identifies subdomains of the target domain.
- **Directory Brute-forcing**: Finds hidden directories and files on the target domain.
- **Port Scanning**: Uses Nmap to scan for open ports and identify services running on the target system.
- **Web Scraping**: Collects emails, subdomains, and directories using web scraping techniques.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

This stage involves checking the target system for common vulnerabilities. The scripts here identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited.

- **Checking for Common Vulnerabilities**: Scripts to detect vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and misconfigurations.
- **Outdated Software Detection**: Compares software versions against known vulnerabilities using CVE databases.

### 3. Exploitation

Exploitation involves taking advantage of identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the target system. The scripts in this section automate the exploitation process.

- **Automating Exploitation**: Uses tools like Metasploit to automate the exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Payload Generation**: Creates custom payloads for various attack vectors.

### 4. Reporting

After performing the penetration test, it's crucial to document the findings in a detailed report. This section includes scripts for generating comprehensive reports and logs.

- **Generating Reports**: Develops detailed reports including executive summaries, technical details, and remediation suggestions.
- **Logging**: Maintains logs of the penetration testing activities.

## Installation
